Student Grade Analysis
This project performs data exploration, cleaning, and analysis on a dataset containing student information and their final grades. The analysis includes finding correlations, visualizing distributions, and summarizing key insights like average grades, gender differences, and study time influences.

This project performs the following tasks:

Data Exploration: It explores the dataset, checking for missing values and displaying data types.
Data Cleaning: The code removes duplicate entries and handles missing values by replacing them with the median for numerical columns.
Data Analysis: The average final grade (G3), the number of students scoring above 15, the correlation between study time and final grade, and the gender-based average final grade are calculated.
Data Visualization: Various plots are created, such as histograms, scatter plots, and bar charts, to visually explore the data.
